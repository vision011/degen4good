degen4good is a prediction‑market inspired web app that combines real Polymarket data with a donation‑driven twist. Users explore live markets, connect their wallet, make play‑point predictions, and trigger mock donations toward real causes whenever a prediction “loses.” The goal is to turn speculative behavior into positive impact through a simple, clear user experience.
